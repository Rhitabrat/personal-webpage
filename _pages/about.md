I am a PhD Student in Computer Science (Natural Language Processing) at Portland State University, under the guidance of <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~ameeta/">Dr. Ameeta Agrawal</a> (<a href="https://nlp.cs.pdx.edu/">PortNLP Lab</a>). Currently, I am working on large language models (LLMs) and low resource languages.

I am open to collaboration on topics related to low-resource languages, machine translation (MT), MT post-editing (MTPE), idiomaticity, multi-word expressions, social media information extraction or anything pertaining to NLP and ML. I am in the job market for <span style="color: #f92080;">Research Internship</span> for <span style="color: #f92080;">the summer of 2024</span>.
