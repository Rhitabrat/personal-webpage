I am a PhD Student in Computer Science (Natural Language Processing) at Portland State University, under the guidance of <a href="http://web.cecs.pdx.edu/~ameeta/">Dr. Ameeta Agrawal</a> (<a href="https://nlp.cs.pdx.edu/">PortNLP Lab</a>). Currently, I am working on improving LLM's multilingual ability. I have also worked on projected related to low-resource languages, machine translation (MT), MT post-editing (MTPE), idiomaticity, multi-word expressions, and social media information extraction. 

I am on the lookout for <span style="color: #f92080;">Internship</span> or  <span style="color: #f92080;">Full-Time positions</span>.
